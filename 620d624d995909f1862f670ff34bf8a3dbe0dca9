      "message": "Except python-subunit, junitxml, testrepository, mock and there recursive dependencies all other should be moved to setup.py(install_requires). Because they are software dependencies.  \n\nOnce it is done, I would recommend to have a test-requirements.in and generate test-requirements.txt manually. So that in Future, engineers can add/remove dependencies in test-requrements.in and generate test-requirements.txt using pip-compile tool(auto generated .txt will have instructions to use pip-compile)\n\npip-compile is just a suggestion",
