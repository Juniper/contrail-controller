      "message": "Yes. This involves \n1. Moving the do_until_loop.yml presently under wait_for_fpc_online role into a common location so as to be used by all roles that need a retry logic.\n2. Currently, the wait_for_fpc_online invokes this invariably, however it is better if we were to have it under vendor specific logic like juniper.yml\n3. Have the conditions for retry passed in as a parameter to the common do_until_loop.yml instead of hardcoding - Currently, I cant find a way of doing this but I can research.\n\nSo I am opening a tracking PR (https://contrail-jws.atlassian.net/browse/CEM-9271) to refactor this and test it all of this together for 1911. For 1910 can we have these changes as it would still unblock the user from the current bug.",
