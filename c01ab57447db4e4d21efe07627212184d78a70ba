      "message": "I dont have the entire context of this template but in general the routes could be learnt from evpn protocol too (like type5 routes on CRB-Gateway based on type2 learnt from CRB-Access) so in which case we may not be adding the RT before exporting to the remote peer. I may be wrong with the example usecase i picked since i dont see any Routing instance configuration above.\n\nPlease consider talking to JunOS team before changing the templates.",

      "message": "1)This should be applicable only for lean spine (when leaf is ERB and MCAST GW is on spine).  CRB spine can advertise routes.\nLean spine is advertising back all routes which is not desirable. If spine is lean it doesnt have any routes to advertise except direct.\n2) This issue came as both l3vpn \u0026 evpn routes come from contrail .\n If only one encap is configured this might not happen ( provided that  both DC GW and CRB GW  works with vxlan encap)",
