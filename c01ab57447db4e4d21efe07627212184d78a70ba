      "message": "I dont have the entire context of this template but in general the routes could be learnt from evpn protocol too (like type5 routes on CRB-Gateway based on type2 learnt from CRB-Access) so in which case we may not be adding the RT before exporting to the remote peer. I may be wrong with the example usecase i picked since i dont see any Routing instance configuration above.\n\nPlease consider talking to JunOS team before changing the templates.",
