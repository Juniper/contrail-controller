      "message": "I don\u0027t see any in this code. I wrote it in a pattern similar to existing methods.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned on channel CEM-11069 there are problems with having both aeXX interfaces and VPGs with ae_num \u003d XX on the same physical router. They are not always available in ZK, so there are two bugged scenarios here:\n\n1. Zookeeper has a registry of this ae_id, so probably VPG was configured properly and is using this ID while \"aeXX\" interface was made later without or with another ae_id (how can we check this?)\n\n2. Zookeeper doesn\u0027t have this ae_id, so probably VPG was created with problems. Does it mean that VPG tried to push config with this ae_id, but it failed because ID was already taken by \"aeXX\" interface?\n\nThe described problem is not affecting this code/methods, but we should investigate it and in the future add additional heal method for such cases.",
