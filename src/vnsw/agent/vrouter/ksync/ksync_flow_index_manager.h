////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// The module is responsible to manage assignment of vrouter flow-table index
// to the flow.
//
// The module maintains following information,
//
// KSyncFlowIndexManager::IndexTree
//     Common table containing information about which flow owns the index.
//     Each entry in tree is of type KSyncFlowIndexManager::IndexEntry.
//     It contains,
//     owner_      : Flow owning the index
//     wait_entry_ : Flow waiting for index to be available.
//                   VRouter does not evict flows in Hold state. Hence, the
//                   assumtion is, there can atmost be one flow waiting
//                   on an index
//
// KSyncFlowIndexEntry
//     Entry allocated per flow-entry. Important fields are,
//     index_       : The flow index currently owned by the flow.
//     state_       : Evication state for the entry. (Documented below)
//     index_owner_ : If the index for flow is not available, the entry
//                    points to flow owning the index
//
// The module tracks index last used by a flow. When a flow is invoked, agent
// will agent will get one more flow add message. The new flow-index used may
// be same as old one or different.
//
// On a flow-add, the module checks if index is free or not.
// 1. New flow is created and gets an new free index
//    Scenario:
//    Flow-1 is created and gets index-1 which is free
//
//    Processing:
//    Flow-1 is marked for INDEX_CHANGE
//    Agent allocates entry in flow-index tree and writes flow to VRouter
//
// 2. New flow is created and gets index allocated to an evicted flow
//    Scenario:
//    Flow-1 is created and gets index-1 which was earlier allocated to an
//    evicted flow(Flow-2)
//
//    Processing:
//    Sets state for Flow-1 to INDEX_WAIT
//    Sets state for Flow-2 to INDEX_EVICT
//    Starts eviction of Flow-2 by deleting it
//    After Flow-2 is deleted, Flow-1 is allocated index index-1
//
// 3. Flow is evicted and created again with same index as before
//    Scenario:
//    Flow-1 with index-1 is evicted. Later Flow-1 is created again with index-1
//
//    Processing:
//    Flow-1 is marked for INDEX_CHANGE
//    Flow-1 is evicted in agent. KSync entry is deleted as part of eviction
//    After KSync entry is deleted, Flow-1 is allocated index-1 again
//
// 4. Flow is evicted and created with a new free index
//    Scenario:
//    Flow-1 with index-1 is evicted. Later Flow-1 is created with index-2
//
//    Processing:
//    Flow-1 is marked for INDEX_CHANGE
//    Flow-1 is evicted in agent. KSync entry is deleted as part of eviction
//    After KSync entry is deleted, Flow-1 is allocated with index-2
//
// 5. Flow is evicted and gets created with index of another evicted flow
//    Scenario:
//    Flow-1 with index-1 is evicted. Flow-2 with index-2 is evicted
//    Later Flow-1 is created with index-2
//
//    Processing:
//    Sets state for Flow-1 to INDEX_WAIT
//    Sets state for Flow-2 to INDEX_EVICT
//    Starts eviction of Flow-2 by deleting it
//    After Flow-2 is deleted, Flow-1 is allocated index index-2
//
// 6. Flow-1 has index-1, Flow-2 has index-2. Both Flow-1 and Flow-2 evicted
//    In next iteration Flow-1 has index-2 and Flow-2 has index-1
//
//    Flow-1 releases the index-1 first
//    Flow-1 tries to acquire index-1. Results in eviction of Flow-2
//    Flow-2 in meanwhile has changed flow_handle
//    Eviction request for Flow-2 is ignored since flow-handle do not match
//    Eventually Flow-2 releases index-2 and Flow-1 acquires the index
