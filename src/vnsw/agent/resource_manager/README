ResourceManager
---------------
This module mainly responsible for storing the MPLS label data to file using Sandesh encoding.
This needs to be extended for config and routing modules.

Functionality:
-------------
    1) Resource manager is split in to 2 modules Resotore & Backup modules.
    2) ResourceTable this is resposible to maintain Key & data pair.
    3) Index resource Table allocate unique index this will be used to reresent resource index. 
        for further reference.
    4) Sandesh module this is mainly to encode the data and store in to file in binary format.

modules:

ResourceManager:
---------------
This class is responsible for restoring the resources. and retain the config's upon reading.
it also triggers the resource allocation by using the key defind by the feature.
Maintains the Restore WorkQueue to restore the data from file

ResourceTable:
-------------
This class is resposible for allocating & restoring the the resources.
it maintains Key data Map. this Key & data will be used to audit the resource data.
and deletes the if there are any stale entries after restoring the data

IndexResourceTable:
------------------
 This Class maintains the index resource vector for resourcekey.
 For every resource key  unique index will be allocated which will be
 represented as MPLS label currently.  or it can be represented as respective 
 resource Index

ResourceBackupManager:
---------------------
This Class maintains the WorKQueue for backup the data.
it reads the data from WorkQueue and Triggers the backup of data to fileis

BackUpResourceTable:
------------------
Backup Resource Table maintains all the Sandesh data to
resource index in a map. Timer is maintained per Backup Resource table.
will be used to trigger Write to file based on idle time out logic.
Trigger will be intiated Only when we don't see any frequent Changes
in the Data modifications with in the idle time out range if we see any change 
Write will be postponed to next time slot otherwise Write to file will happens upon 
fallback time period
