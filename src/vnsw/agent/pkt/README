Handles the exception packets sent from vrouter. Packets are received on the
pkt0 tap interface, parsed and sent to appropriate module. Following are the 
packet handling modules:
    - Flow
    - Arp
    - Dhcp
    - Dns
    - Icmp
    - Diag

PktHandler is the class which receives the packets from TapInterface and parses
them. Respective modules register a work queue with the PktHandler, into which
the packets are queued.

The packet handling modules use the Proto and ProtoHandler objects. Proto or a
derived object represents the module (single object instantiation). This holds
the work queue for the module, which is handled in the corresponding packet
handling task. For each packet, a ProtoHandler or a derived object is
instantiated, in which the packet is handled.

Messages to the packet handling module are also sent to the same work queue and
are handled in the same manner.
