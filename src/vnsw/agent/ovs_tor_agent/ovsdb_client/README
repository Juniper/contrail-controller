OVSDB Client
------------
OVSDB client in Contrail solution is part of the ToR Agent, where it is
responsible to interface Contrail config with ToR switches used OVSDB

it connects to OVSDB using either of the following
- TCP where ToR hosts tcp port for connection, this is a non-secure mode
  and is deprecated
- PSSL where ToR agent will host an ssl port and switch initiates connection

Currently ovsdb client supports only the hw_vtep OVSDB schema, which is used
to manage ToR switches

OVSDB Client translates the OpenContrail configuration to OVSDB and populates
the relevant OVSDB table entries in the TOR switch.
The following table maps the OpenContrail configuration objects to
the OVSDB tables.

   Contrail Objects          |     OVSDB Tables
-----------------------------|------------------------------
    Physical Device          |    Physical Switch
    Physical Interface       |    Physical Port
    Virtual Networks         |    Logical Switch
    Logical Interface        |    <Vlan, Physical Port> binding to Logical Switch
    L2 Unicast Route table   |    Unicast Remote and Local Table
    -                        |    Multicast Remote Table
    -                        |    Multicast Local Table
    -                        |    Physical Locator Table
    -                        |    Physical Locator Set Table

Basic Functionality
-------------------
The TOR Agent receives the EVPN entries (routes) for the virtual networks in
which the TOR switch ports are members. These are added to the unicast remote
table in the OVSDB.

MAC addresses learnt in the TOR switch in different logical switches (entries
from local table in OVSDB) are propagated to the TOR Agent. TOR Agent exports
them to the control node in the corresponding EVPN tables, which are further
distributed to other controllers and subsequently to compute nodes and other
EVPN nodes in the cluster.

The TSN node receives the replication tree for each virtual network from the
control node. The other compute nodes also receive the replication tree from
the control node and this tree includes the TSN node.

Local MAC Address Cleanup
-------------------------
Per OVSDB schema Local MAC address unicast and multicast table is owned by ToR
So deletion of Logical Switch has to wait for ToR Switch to withdraw all its
local MAC which is usually bound with programming and withdrawing of vlan-port
bindings.
If ToR fails to withdraw is local MAC within 15 mins it results into VRF delete
timeout due to failure of deletion of logical-switch, VN and VRF

HA Solution
-----------
when ToR agent stops or OVSDB connection flaps, peer routes are withdrawn
immediately, which results in traffic disrupption for existing unicast stream
To Avoid this disrupption ToR agent runs a HA stale peer for all the ToRs
managed by ToR Agent(both active and backup), which publish a low priority
route. this in turn ensures that in failure scenarios we hold on to the routes
exported by ToR for the timeout window to allow unicast traffic to continue 

As a side effect any MAC aging will result in Stale route of low priority to
be present for an extended configured timeout

VxLAN ID reuse
--------------
OVSDB schema doesnot use VxLAN ID as the key how ever QFX and may be other ToRs
implementation will not be able to handle duplication of VxLAN ID for different
Logical switches. In case of QFX it leads to commit failures.

OVSDB client implements resource management infra for VxLAN ID to ensure that
it doesn't send duplicate VxLAN ID to OVSDB server at any point of time,
avoiding possible ambiguities. In case a VxLAN ID is already in use new logical
switch waits in a queue for resource to get free'd before using it and
programming to OVSDB database.

In case logical switch fails to get newly assigned VxLAN ID (because of in-use)
it starts clean up of logical switch by deleting vlan-port bindings and remote
MAC addresses to free up exiting used VxLAN ID to avoid cyclic dependencies
for VxLAN ID. if new VxLAN ID is available before the deletion went through
completely OVSDB client cancels the deletion and update the new VxLAN ID to
OVSDB server freeing old VxLAN ID.

Multiple Physical Switch Handling
---------------------------------
OVSDB allows two ways to provide handling of multiple Physical Switches
- Multiple Physical Switches/ToRs can appear on the same ovsdb_server/ToR agent
  session, like Arista Cloud Vision OVSDB model.
- Single Physical Switch resides over one ovsdb_server, however multiple such
  entities comes and connect to same ToR agent over different sessions

ToR agent do need following to handle above cases.
- Export multicast local MAC as EVPN route with ToR IP, so that we will be able
  to distinguish and allow same Virtual Network to have multiple multicast
  routes exported and held in Oper
- Allow programming of Logical Switch as long as any Physical Device VN has a
  corresonding Physical Switch available on the ovsdb server (ovsdb idl), and
  should withdraw the logical switch when we donot have Physical Switch
  available corresponding to any of the Physical Device VN
