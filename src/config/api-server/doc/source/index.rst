Juniper Contrail Configuration API Server Documentation
=======================================================

The Juniper Contrail configuration API server enables the manipulation of configuration
elements exposed by the VNS. Interaction with the API server is possible by means of a REST interface
or a python library (which internally uses the same REST API). 

This document provides
   * Tutorials for using the REST and library interfaces,
   * General examples to work on different configuration elements
   * Tips to use the system effectively
   * Reference to the package, module and classes involved.
