// Routing Policy Manager
// This class implements the routing policy for control node.
// It maintains the list of routing policies configured on the system
// It provides API to lookup the routing policy by name.
//
// It provides two APIs to apply routing policy on the routes belonging to given
// routing instance.
// 1. ApplyRoutingPolicy
//    Apply routing policy on the routing instance passed as input.
//    To achieve this Routing policy manager walks all the routing tables of
//    the routing instance. On each route encountered during the walk, policy
//    is evaluated using EvaluateRoutingPolicy. EvaluateRoutingPolicy visits
//    all the BgpPath and apply all routing policies of that routing instance
//    on that BgpPath.
//
// 2. ExecuteRoutingPolicy
//     This function is called on the given route + path from two code path.
//     First one is from InsertPath. i.e. when new path is being added to a
//     route.
//     Second path is from DBTable walk context while applying the routing
//     policy on routing instance.  This function calls the operator() of the
//     policy in input to match and apply the action on successful match.
//
//
// RoutingPolicyManager takes a delete reference of BgpServer.
//
// RoutingPolicy
//
// This represents one Routing Policy in operational data.
// Each routing policy has multiple policy terms (represented using PolicyTerm
// class) represented as ordered list using std::list.
//
// Routing Policy object takes lifetime reference of RoutingPolicyMgr.
//
// Reference to RoutingPolicy object is done using intrusive pointer which
// keeps track of ref_count.
// The DeleteActor of the RoutingPolicy uses this ref_count to allow/disallow
// delete of the RoutingPolicy object. On last dereference of the RoutingPolicy
// object, RetryDelete on the DeleteActor is triggered.
//
// RoutingPolicy is removed from the name-map in RoutingPolicyMgr  only in
// Destroy method of DeleteActor. It is possible that config might have revived
// the RoutingPolicy object with same name(with same or different config).
// In such case, RoutingPolicyMgr recreate the routing policy based on the
// new config object.
//
// RoutingPolicy object provided operator() to apply the policy on a
// BgpRoute+BgpPath. In this operator overload function, route is processed
// against each policy term till a terminal rule is encountered.
// A terminal rule is a term where action on successful match is to Reject or
// Accept the route. Return value gives the hint of result of policy apply.
// Result is represented as a pair with first element representing whether the
// match was for terminal rule and second element indicating whether there
// was a policy match.
//
// RoutingPolicy object is updated on config update function in UpdateConfig
// method. This method walks newly configured policy term list and existing
// policy term list and compares the PolicyTerm to see whether
//    a. Policy term matches (Done using operator==() function on PolicyTerm).
//       If no match is found, new PolicyTerm as per new config is created and
//       inserted in to ordered list of PolicyTerm.
//    b. New policy Term is inserted
//    c. Existing policy term is deleted
// At the end of the update, generation number of the policy term is updated to
// indicate config change to Routing Policy. Routing Instances referring to
// this policy is not triggered from this path. It is expected that
// BgpConfigListener infra would put the RoutingInstance to the change_list when
// the routing policy it is referring undergoes a change.
//
// Routing Instance
// Routing instance maintains an ordered list of routing policies that is refers.
// This is represented as std::list of pair<RoutingPolicyPtr, gen-id of policy>.
// Please note RoutingPolicyPtr is an intrusive pointer to RoutingPolicy object.
//
// While processing the routing policies on each routes belonging to this
// instance, each of routing policies are applied till terminal rule is hit.
// BgpRoute is update with all policy actions from the matching policy term.
// Policy action is stored in BgpPath (in flag ond/or in BgpAttr)
//
// Update of the routing instance checks whether the routing policy list on the
// instance has changed. This process checks for following
//   a. If a routing policy order is update
//   b. If new routing policy(ies) are added to the routing policy list
//   c. If existing routing policy(ies) are removed from the routing policy list
//   d. If the routing policies that it is referring has undergone config change
//      This is done by checking the generation number of routing policy that
//      is applied on the routing instance.
// In case the routing policy is updated on the routing instance
// (if either of (a) to (d) above is true), all the BgpTables belonging to the
// routing instance is walked to reapply the routing policy.
//
// BgpRoute/BgpPath
// BgpPath maintains original BgpAttribute that it received in a new field
// called as original_attr_. The path attribute attr_ represents the
// BgpAttribute after applying the policy.
// New flag is introduced to indicate if the path is rejected by routing policy.
//
// PolicyTerm
// Policy Term has two ordered lists
//      1. Match conditions
//      2. Actions
//
// PolicyTerm class provides accessor method to get list of matches and actions.
// It also provides compare function (operator==()) to check whether two policy
// terms matches/same. It would return true if each policy term has same match
// set(ordered list) and same action list(ordered).
//
// Policy action is represented as ordered list of action to be taken on
// successful match. The top of the action list indicates what should be done
// with route on successful match. e.g. Accept/Reject/NextTerm.
// Subsequent entry in this list are the update action to be taken on policy
// match.
//
// Match Condition
// RoutingPolicyMatch is the abstract base class to implement a match condition.
// This abstract class provides Match() function to compare the route + Path
// attribute with match condition. The derived class provides implementation
// to compare the route + attribute with match condition. Another method of this
// class is comparator function operator==(). This method compares whether two
// match conditions are same. This is done by comparing the typeid() (RTTI) and
// calling IsEqual pure virtual method if type ids are same.
//
// All match conditions inherit this RoutingPolicyMatch and provide
// implementation of pure virtual methods.
// In the current release, match is supported on Community and prefix.
//
// MatchCommunity implements match for community value
// MatchPrefix provides templetized implementation for matching prefix.
// Currently PrefixMatchInet and PrefixMatchInet6 implementation is supported
// to match inet and inet6 routes.
//
// Policy Action
// RoutingPolicyAction is the abstract base class for implementing the policy
// action.
// Action is represented as
//      RoutingPolicyNexTermAction,
//      RoutingPolicyRejectAction,
//      RoutingPolicyAcceptAction or
//      RoutingPolicyUpdateAction
// This represents NextTerm, Reject, accept and route update action respectively
// RoutingPolicyRejectAction & RoutingPolicyAcceptAction as Terminal actions.
// RoutingPolicyNexTermAction and RoutingPolicyAcceptAction may/may not have
// RoutingPolicyUpdateAction associated with it.
// RoutingPolicyUpdateAction represents the modification done to path attribute
// on successful match.
// RoutingPolicyAction provides comparator function to check whether two actions
// are same. This is done by comparing the typeid() of the object and invoking
// IsEqual when typeid() is same.
// RoutingPolicyUpdateAction which inherits the RoutingPolicyAction provides the
// pure virtual method operator() to apply update action on BgpAttr.
// Currently support for updating the local-pref and community list is supported
// for update action.
// UpdateCommunity supports add/remove/set list of
// community to incoming BgpAttr.
