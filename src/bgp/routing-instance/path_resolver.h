// This represents an instance of the resolver per BgpTable. A BgpTable that
// with BgpPaths that need resolution will have an instance of PathResolver.
//
// The [Start|Update|Stop]PathResolution APIs are invoked by PathResolution
// clients explicitly as required. They have to be invoked in context of the
// db::DBTable Task.
//
// The listener_id is used by ResolverPath to set ResolverRouteState on the
// BgpRoute for the BgpPaths in question. The PathResolver doesn't actually
// listen to notifications for routes in the BgpTable.
//
// The nexthop map keeps track of all ResolverNexthop for this instance. In
// addition, a given ResolverNexthop may be on the register/unregister list
// and the update list. Entries are added to the map and the lists from the
// db::DBTable Task. A mutex is used to serialize updates to the map and the
// lists. Note that there's no no concurrent access when entries are removed
// from the map and the lists, since the remove operations happen from Tasks
// that are mutually exclusive.
//
// The register/unregister list is processed in the context of bgp::Config
// Task. ResolverNexthops are added to this list when we need to add/remove
// or unregister them to/from the BgpConditionListener. This is done since
// the BgpConditionListener expects these operations to be made in context
// of bgp::Config Task.
//
// When a ResolverNexthop is removed the BgpConditionListener, it is added
// to the delete list. This is required because remove call is asynchronous.
// When BgpConditionListener invokes the remove request done callback, the
// ResolverNexthop is added to the register/unregister list again. It gets
// erased from the delete list and unregistered from BgpConditionListener
// after the list is processed again.
//
// The update list is processed in the context of bgp::ResolverNexthop Task.
// When an entry on this list is processed all it's dependent ResolverPaths
// are queued for re-evaluation in the PathResolverPartition.
//
// Concurrency Notes:
//
// Resolution APIs are invoked from db::DBTable Task.
// Updates to ResolverNexthop (via Match method) happen from db::DBTable Task.
// ResolverNexthop register/unregister list is processed in bgp::Config Task.
// ResolverNexthop update is processed in bgp::ResolverNexthop Task.
// ResolverPath update is processed in bgp::ResolverPath Task.
//
// bgp::Config is mutually exclusive with bgp::ResolverPath
// bgp::Config is mutually exclusive with bgp::ResolverNexthop
// db::DBTable is mutually exclusive with bgp::ResolverPath
