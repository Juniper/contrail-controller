//
// This class represents the export policy for a rib. Given that we do not
// currently support any real policy configuration, this is pretty trivial
// for now.
//
// Including the AS number as part of the policy results in creation of a
// different RibOut for every neighbor AS that we peer with. This allows a
// simplified implementation of the sender side AS path loop check. In most
// practical deployment scenarios all eBGP peers will belong to the same
// neighbor AS anyway.
//
// Including AS override as part of the policy results in creation of a
// different RibOuts for neighbors that need and don't AS override.
//
// Including the nexthop as part of the policy results in creation of a
// different RibOut for each set of BGPaaS clients that belong to the same
// subnet. This allows us to rewrite the nexthop to the specified value.
//
// Including the CPU affinity as part of the RibExportPolicy allows us to
// artificially create more RibOuts than otherwise necessary. This is used
// to achieve higher concurrency at the expense of creating more state.
//
// Including llgr as part of the policy results in the creation of a different
// ribout for each set of peers that do (or do not) support long lived
// graceful restart functionality. In order to ensure correctness, we need
// to not advertise LLGR_STALE community to peers who do not support LLGR.
// Instead, we should bring down the local pref to make the paths less
// preferable.
