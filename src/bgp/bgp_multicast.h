//
// This class represents membership of a vRouter or a control-node in a (G,S)
// within a multicast table.
//
// A vRouter is considered a member if it has advertised a route for (G,S) via
// XMPP. The level_ field in McastForwarder is set to LevelNative in this case.
//
// A control-node is considered to be a member if it has advertised (via BGP)
// an ErmVpnRoute of type LocalRoute for (G,S). The level_ field gets set to
// LevelLocal in this case.

// There's a 1:1 correspondence between an ErmVpnRoute of type NativeRoute or
// LocalRoute and a McastForwarder. Routes in the ErmVpnTable are keyed by RD,
// RouterId, Group and Source. When these routes are processed, we invert the
// information and create a McastSGEntry for each unique (G,S).  Information
// from the RD and the IPeer from which we learnt the route is used to create
// a McastForwarder. The McastForwarder is part of a set in the McastSGEntry
// for the (G,S).
//
// A McastForwarder gets created when the DBListener for the McastTreeManager
// sees a new ErmVpnRoute of type NativeRoute or LocalRoute. It's deleted when
// the DBListener detects that the route in question has been deleted.
//
// A McastForwarder is associated with the ErmVpnRoute by setting it to be the
// DBState for the McastTreeManager's listener id. The McastForwarder keeps a
// back pointer to the ErmVpnRoute.
//
// The LabelBlockPtr is obtained from the attributes of the best path for the
// ErmVpnRoute.  It's used to allocate labels for the McastForwarder without
// needing to reach into the route.  More importantly, it's required to release
// the currently allocated label when the route gets marked for deletion, at
// which time there's no active path for the route.
//
// A McastForwarder contains a vector of pointers to other McastForwarders at
// the same NodeLevel within the McastSGEntry.  The collection of these links
// constitutes the distribution tree for the McastSGEntry at that NodeLevel.
// Note that only a single MPLS label is used for a McastForwarder in a given
// distribution tree. Thus the label can be stored in the McastForwarder itself
// and does not need to be part of the link information.
//
// If this control-node is elected as the tree builder for the (G,S), a global
// distribution tree of all Local McastForwarders is built.  Relevant edges of
// this global distribution tree are advertised to each control-node by adding
// a GlobalTreeRoute for each Local McastForwarder. The global_tree_route_ is
// used to keep track of this ErmVpnRoute and [Add|Delete]GlobalTreeRoute are
// used to add or delete the route.

// This class represents a (G,S) entry within a McastManagerPartition. The

// When these routes are processed, we rearrange the information and create a
// McastSGEntry for each unique (G,S). The RD and RouterId in the ErmVpnRoute
// represent a McastForwarder.
//
// A McastSGEntry is part of a set in the McastManagerPartition. In addition
// is may also temporarily be on the WorkQueue in the McastManagerPartition
// if the distribution tree needs to be updated.
//
// A McastSGEntry is created when the DBListener for the ErmVpnTable sees the
// first ErmVpnRoute containing the (G,S) and needs to create a McastForwarder.
// It is destroyed when all McastForwarders under it are gone. The delete is
// done from the McastManagerPartition's WorkQueue callback routine to ensure
// that there are no stale references to it on the WorkQueue.  Note that the
// WorkQueue cannot contain more than one reference to a given McastSGEntry.
//
// Two sets of pointers to McastForwarders are maintained in a McastSGEntry -
// for Native and Local tree levels. The McastForwarders at the Native level
// correspond to vRouters that have subscribed to the (G,S). McastForwarders
// at the Local level correspond to control-nodes (including this one) that
// are advertising their local subtree's candidate edges via a LocalTreeRoute.
// The sets are keyed by the RD and RouterId of the McastForwarders.
//
// A local distribution tree of all Native McastForwarders is built and the
// last leaf in the tree is designated as the forest node.  The forest_node_
// is used to keep track of this McastForwarder.  A LocalTreeRoute is added to
// the ErmVpnTable and the forest node's candidate edges are advertised using
// the EdgeDiscovery attribute. The local_tree_route_ keeps track of the route.
//
// If this control-node is elected to be the tree builder for this (G,S), a
// global distribution tree of all Local McastForwarders is built.  Relevant
// edges of this global distribution tree are advertised to each control-node
// by adding a GlobalTreeRoute for each Local McastForwarder.  The forwarding
// edges are encoded using the EdgeForwarding attribute.
//
// Whether the tree builder is this control-node or another control-node, the
// tree_result_route_ member keeps track of the GlobalTreeRoute that contains
// the forwarding edges relevant to this control-node.  The RouterId in the
// GlobalTreeRoute is used to decide if it's for this control-node.  We set
// our DBState on this ErmVpnRoute to be the McastSGEntry.
//
// The McastSGEntry is enqueued on the WorkQueue in the McastManagerPartition
// when a McastForwarder is added, changed or deleted so that the distribution
// tree and the necessary LocalTreeRoute or GlobalTreeRoutes can be updated.

// This class represents the multicast tree manager for an ErmVpnTable.

// node is elected to be the tree builder for a (G,S) a global distribution
