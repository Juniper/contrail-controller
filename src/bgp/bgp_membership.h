//
// This class implements membership management for a BgpServer.

// It provides methods for an IPeer to manage it's membership in BgpTables.
// There are two kinds of memberships for a (IPeer, BgpTable) pair - RibIn
// and RibOut. RibIn membership is needed for an IPeer to add BgpPaths to a
// BgpTable. RibOut membership is needed to advertise routes from a BgpTable
// to an IPeer.
//
// APIs are provided to manage these 2 types of memberships together as well
// as separately. An API to walk all BgpPaths added by an IPeer to a BgpTable
// is also provided. This is used by clients to delete BgpPaths when a peer
// is going down, to mark BgpPaths as stale when handling graceful restart of
// a peer etc. The actual logic of deleting or modifying a BgpPath has to be
// in the client code.
//
// Many APIs require traversal of the entire BgpTable and so are asynchronous.
// An IPeer gets notified on completion of API via virtual function callback.
// Along similar lines, when using a walk API, an IPeer gets notified for each
// BgpPath added by it via a virtual function.  A client is allowed to have 1
// outstanding request for a given (IPeer, BgpTable) pair.
//
// There are scenarios where multiple IPeers subscribe to a given BgpTable at
// roughly the same time. Further, this can happen for many BgpTables at about
// the same time as well. The implementation handles this quite efficiently by
// accumulating multiple (IPeer, BgpTable) requests to reduce/minimize the
// number of table walks. The table walk functionality is delegated to the
// Walker class.
//
// Membership information corresponding to (IPeer, BgpTable) pairs is organized
// with the above goal in mind. An IPeer is represented using a PeerState and a
// BgpTable is represented using a RibState. A PeerStateMap and RibStateMap are
// used for efficient lookup and insertion. A (IPeer, BgpTable) is represented
// using a PeerRibState. Linkage between PeerState, RibState, and PeerRibState
// is described in more detail later.
//
// Updates to the PeerStateMap, RibStateMap and other maps/sets maintained in
// a PeerState and RibState can happen synchronously from from the API calls.
// This allows for easy detection of violations in API assumptions e.g. only a
// single outstanding request for a (IPeer, BgpTable) pair. Since multiple API
// calls can happen in parallel, access to internal state has to be serialized
// using a read-write mutex. A read-write mutex is used to allow parallel calls
// to GetRegistrationInfo from multiple db::DBTable tasks. All other API calls
// are relatively infrequent.
//
// The read-write mutex ensures consistency of BgpMembershipManager's internal
// state. However, the BgpMembershipManager also needs to call external APIs
// which have their own concurrency requirements.  A WorkQueue of Events is
// used to satisfy these requirements. The WorkQueue is processed in context
// of bgp::PeerMembership task and appropriate exclusion polices are specified
// at system initialization. Client callbacks for API complete notifications
// are also made from the bgp:PeerMembership task.

// This class is responsible for efficient implementation of BgpTable walks
// for the BgpMembershipManager. It accepts walk requests for any number of
// RibStates and triggers table walks one at a time. It has a maximum of one
// ongoing table walk at any given time.
//
// The RibStateList contains all RibStates for which walks have not yet been
// started. The Walker removes the first RibState from the list and starts a
// table walk for it.
//
// The RibStateSet is used to prevent duplicates in the RibStateList. Using
// just the RibStateSet to maintain the pending RibStates would have caused
// problems if the same RibState is enqueued repeatedly. In that case, the
// Walker would walk the same BgpTable repeatedly and starve out all other
// RibStates. Using the RibStateSet and RibStateList together prevents this
// problem.
//
// Items are inserted into RibStateList either from the bgp::PeerMembership
// task or from other tasks that invoke the BgpMembershipManager public APIs.
// There's no issues with concurrent access in the former case. In the latter
// case, access is serialized because of the mutex in BgpMembershipManager.
//
// The Walker creates temporary internal state when it starts a table walk so
// that walk callbacks for each DBEntry can be handled with minimal processing
// overhead. Details on this temporary state are as follows:
//
// - walk_id_ is the id for the current walk
// - rs_ is the RibState for which the walk was started
// - peer_rib_list_ is the list of PeerRibStates for the current RibState
//   that have a pending action. The pending list in RibState is logically
//   moved to this field. This allows the RibState to accumulate a new set
//   of pending PeerRibStates that can be serviced in a subsequent walk.
//   The peer_rib_list_ is used to create and enqueue events when the table
//   walk finishes.
// - peer_list_ is the list of IPeers to be notified about BgpPaths added
//   by them for RibIn processing.
// - ribout_state_map_ is a map of RibOutStates that need to be processed
//   for each route.
// - ribout_state_list_ is a list of same RibOutStates as ribout_state_map_.
//   It allows simpler traversal compared to the ribout_state_map_ when each
//   DBEntry is processed.
//
// A RibOutState is created for each unique RibOut in the PeerRibStates in
// peer_rib_list_. It's join and leave bitsets are based on the action in
// the PeerRibStates.
//
// A TaskTrigger that runs in context of bgp::PeerMembership task is used to
// handle start and finish of table walks. This avoids concurrency issues in
// accessing/clearing the pending list in the RibState. Note that TaskTrigger
// in this class and the WorkQueue in BgpMembershipManager both use instance
// id of 0, so they can't run concurrently.
