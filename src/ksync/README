KSync implements logic to SYNC the state of runtime objects in VNSwitch agent
to Kernel.

KSync provides following functionality,
- Infrastructure to sync objects from Agent to Kernel
- Each entry in kernel is represented as a one KSyncEntry in Agent space
  Ex: Each interface (like eth0, eth1...) has corresponding KSyncEntry in Agent
- Each KSyncEntry implements a state-machine to,
    - Optimize number of writes to kernel
        - Notification to kernel are implemented as requests
        - Only one outstanding request is pending with kernel at any time
        - When request is pending, subsequent requests are deferred
        - On getting ACK for a request, KSyncEntry is re-evaluated to see if 
          any further changes must be sent to kernel
    - Support object dependencies
        - State machine helps implement dependency constraints
        - This is best explained by an example,
            - If Object-A refers to Object-B, Object-A cannot be sent to 
              Kernel till Object-B is sent.
            - When Object-A is to be sent to Kernel, it checks if Object-B is 
              already in kernel. If not, it informs infrastrcture of failed
              dependency 
            - KSync infrastructure maintains back-reference tree. Object-A is 
              put in back-ref tree for Object-B
            - After Object-B is sent to Kernel, it will notify to state-machine
            - State machine will re-evaluate if Object-A can be sent to Kernel.
              If all constraints are met, then Object-A will be sent to Kernel
        - If Object-B is not yet created, then a KSyncEntry will be created
          with TEMP state.

- Each entry is optionally allocated an index. The index can be used for cross 
  referencing of objects
    - Example, Route entries point to nexthop in Agent. In config message from 
      agent to kernel, route entry will refer to a nexthop using the index
    - The index is managed within KSync module and the Route processing logic
      will not be aware of it
    - The index for entries can be allocated by either KSync or by Kernel.
        - The index for interfaces can be allocated by kernel
        - Index for route entries can be allocated by KSync
- Reference couting
    - Each KSyncEntry has a ref-count.
    - The KSyncEntry delete message is sent to kernel only when all its 
      reference are gone

KSync functionality given above are implemented by following classes,

KSyncEntry : 
------------
This is basic class implementing the state-machine. It invokes following
virtual functions,
    - Add       : Invoked when an object must be added to Kernel. 
                  If the function returns false, it means Add is not complete.
                  On completion of operation, a ADD_ACK event must be notified 
                  to state machine. Till then state-machine gets into a 
                  wait-state

                  If the function returns true, it means the operation is 
                  complete and state-machine moves without waiting for any 
                  further events

    - Change    : Invoked when an object must be changed in Kernel
    - Delete    : Invoked when an object is to be deleted from Kernel
    - UnresolvedReference : Must implement dependency check for the object. 
                  Must return NULL if constraints met and object can be added.
                  Must return object if constraint is not met. State-machine 
                  will wait till the returned object is Added

KSyncObject:
------------
Each table or object in Kernel is represented as KSyncObject in agent. It acts
as a container of helper functions.

Additionally, KSync module provides helper implementation for most common 
cases

KSyncDBEntry:
-------------
Implementation of KSyncEntry associated with a DBEntry. The infrastructure will
register to the DBTable as a client. The events to state-machine are automatically triggerred based on Notification from DBTable.

KSyncNetlinkDBEntry:
--------------------
Implementation of KSyncDBEntry associated with a DBEntry. Messages to kernel are
sent using asynchronous Netlink sockets. 

It overrides the Add/Change/Delete methods. Instead, it expects implementations
for AddMsg/ChangeMsg/DeleteMsg to generate message for Add/Change/Delete on
Netlink sockets

KSyncNetlinkEntry : 
-------------------
Implementation of KSyncEntry where objects are written to kernel using Netlink
ASIO sockets. It does not work on DBTable notifications. It is responsibility
of application to trigger events to the state-machine.
