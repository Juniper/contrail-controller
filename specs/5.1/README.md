Specs for Contrail Version 5.1
==============================

Contrail 5.0 is under development and the 5.1 planning phase has not yet
begun, however at this time (January 2018) it is too late to start new 5.0
specs from scratch. Work planned for post-5.0 may be described in specs
posted to this directory. Corresponding blueprints should be created under
the same trunk URL as 5.0 blueprints but they will eventually be separated.

Specs for 5.1 will be considered by theTechnical Steering Committed (TSC)
and Architecture Review Board (ARB) once the planning phase for 5.1 starts,
but there's no reason contributors can't begin working on content earlier if
they choose.

r5.1 Series Launchpad
---------------------
At this time (January 2018) the newly developed process requires that all
Contrail features have a blueprint under the "opencontrail" project on
Launchpad, but no series has been created yet so this URL shows all blueprints:
https://blueprints.launchpad.net/opencontrail

Milestones
----------
At this time (January 2018) no series or milestones have been created yet.
