#1. Introduction
Analytics API RBAC provides ability to access UVE and query information based
on the permissions of the user for the UVE or queried object.

#2. Problem statement
Currently Analytics API supports authenticated access for cloud-admin role.
However to display network monitoring for tenant pages in the UI, analytics
API needs to support RBAC similar to config API so that the tenants can only
view information about the networks for which they have the read permissions.

#3. Proposed solution
Analytics API will map query and UVE objects to configuration objects on
which RBAC rules are applied so that read permissions can be verified using
VNC API.

Analytics API RBAC will be implemented in 2 phases:

## Phase 1:
1. All statistics, flow, and log queries are allowed only for cloud-admin
   role and hence for tenant, the query pages need to be greyed out in the
   UI.
2. All UVEs list queries (e.g. analytics/uves/virtual-networks/) are allowed
   only for cloud-admin role. For displaying appropriate networks on the
   monitoring page, UI will have to get the list of networks with read
   permissions for the user using the VNC API. VM and VMI information are
   obtained from the VN UVEs and hence no other change should be needed
   on the UI.
3. UVE query for specific resource (e.g. analytics/uves/virtual-network/vn1),
   contrail-analytics-api will check the object level read permissions using
   VNC API.

## Phase 2:
1. For flow and log queries, we will evaluate the object read permissions for
   each AND term in the where query.
2. For statistics queries, we will add annotations to sandesh file so that
   indexes/tag on statistics queries can be associated with objects/UVEs.
   These can then be added to the schema and used by contrail-analytics-api
   to determine the object level read permissions.
3. Some tables like the FieldNamesTable will still be accessible to only
   cloud-admin role and hence drop-downs on some of the UI pages will not
   work for tenants.
4. For UVEs list queries (e.g. analytics/uve/virtual-networks/),
   contrail-analytics-api will use VNC API to determine whether the user
   has read permission for each UVE object.

##3.1 Alternatives considered
None

##3.2 API schema changes
None

##3.3 User workflow impact
Tenants will not be able to view the query pages in Phase 1.

##3.4 UI changes
### Phase 1:
1. UI needs to use VNC API to get list of networks to display in the
   network monitoring page based on the tenant user.
2. Query pages need to be greyed out for tenant user.

##3.5 Notification impact
None

#4. Implementation
## Phase 1:
* Currently VNC API provides obj_perms function which takes object
  UUID and token, and returns the permissions.
* For every UVE, UUID of corresponding config object will be retrieved from
  ContrailConfig struct of UVE, wherever present. All other UVEs will be
  treated as infrastructure UVEs for which analytics-api will allow
  cloud-admin roles and won't check object level permissions. Here is the list
  of UVEs having ContrailConfig structure:

        * virtual_network
        * virtual_machine
        * virtual_machine_interface
        * service_instance
        * virtual_router
        * analytics_node
        * database_node
        * config_node
        * service_chain
        * physical_router
        * bgp_router

## Phase 2:
* UVEs list queries (e.g. analytics/uve/virtual-networks)

  There will be a mapping from uve-type (virtual-network in the example) to
  corresponding uve table (ObjectVNTable in the example) and config object
  type (virtual_network for this example). For a uve list query, analytics-api
  will pass config object type and user token to ApiServer to get a list of
  objects that the user has permissions for. This is how the mapping table
  will look like:

            "virtual-network" : ("ObjectVNTable", virtual_network),
            "service-instance" : ("ObjectSITable", service_instance),
            "vrouter" : ("ObjectVRouter", virtual_router),
            "analytics-node" : ("ObjectCollectorInfo", analytics_node),
            "database-node" : ("ObjectDatabaseInfo", database_node),
            "config-node" : ("ObjectConfigNode", config_node),
            "service-chain" : ("ServiceChain", service_chain),
            "prouter" : ("ObjectPRouter", physical_router),
            "control-node": ("ObjectBgpRouter", bgp_router),
* System Logs and Flow Logs

  These are displayed for cloud-admin roles only
* Object Logs

  A reverse mapping of object log type to config object type will be created
  using the mapping in previous section. For an object-log query, using ths
  mapping, get corresponding config object type. ApiServer will use this
  object type and user token, to return list of objects with read permissions.
  'ObjectId' will be the only where clause supported for non-admin users. This
  clause can be used to filter the list of config objects returned by
  ApiServer.
* Statistics

  Supporting stats tables for tenants will require changes in sandesh files.
  A new annotation (uve\_type) will be added for every member that is used as
  index in stats tables. This uve\_type will be added to the stats table schema.
  During query, analytics-api will retrieve uve_type for each tag. It will be
  used to get corresponding config object type using the mapping table defined
  in previous section. For every tag, list of permitted objects will be
  retrieved using config-type and user token.

  Here is an example of the changes in sandesh file. A stat table in
  virtual_network.sandesh is specified like this:

          optiona list<InterVnStats>        vn_stats (tags=".other_vn,.vrouter")

  Corresponding tags are defined in structure InterVnStats:

          string                         other_vn
          string                         vrouter

  These tags will be changed to:

          string                         other_vn (uve_type="virtual-network")
          string                         vrouter  (uve_type="vrouter")

  Corresponding stats table schema will also change from:

          {
                datatype: "string",
                index: true,
                name: "vn_stats.other_vn",
                suffixes: null
          },
          {
                datatype: "string",
                index: true,
                name: "vn_stats.vrouter",
                suffixes: null
          }

  to:

          {
                uve_type: "virtual-network",
                datatype: "string",
                index: true,
                name: "vn_stats.other_vn",
                suffixes: null
          },
          {
                uve_type: "vrouter",
                datatype: "string",
                index: true,
                name: "vn_stats.vrouter",
                suffixes: null
          }

#5. Performance and scaling impact
##5.1 API and control plane
API server will have to make additional calls per invocation of obj_perms
API from VNC API for each analytics API call to verify the object level read
permissions.

##5.2 Forwarding performance
Not affected

#6. Upgrade
We will not change the ```DEFAULTS.aaa_mode``` during upgrade if it exists in
```/etc/contrail/contrail-analytics-api.conf```. However new installations
will default to ```rbac``` instead of the current ```cloud-admin```.

#7. Deprecations
None

#8. Dependencies
None

#9. Testing
##9.1 Unit tests
Opserver systemless tests will be added.
##9.2 Dev tests
##9.3 System tests

#10. Documentation Impact
```/etc/contrail/contrail-analytics-api.conf``` - section ```DEFAULTS```,
parameter ```aaa_mode``` will now support ```rbac``` as one of the values.
