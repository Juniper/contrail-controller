Specs for Contrail Version 5.0
==============================

Contrail 5.0 is the first release after the "Community Reboot of 2017" and
during the release planning timeframe more formal processes were under
development, including the creation of a Technical Steering Committed (TSC)
and Architecture Review Board (ARB) with the initial introduction of review
and approval processes.

At this time blueprints on Launchpad were transitioned from the
"juniperopenstack" project to the "opencontrail" project although there had
previously been some blueprints under the "opencontrail" project.

The specs in this directory represent the first release for which a significant
oversight effort was made to ensure that new features have both a blueprint
and a spec. However, there may still be gaps if anything slipped through the
newly developed and not entirely complete processes.

r5.0 Series Launchpad
---------------------
At this time (January 2018) the newly developed process requires that all
Contrail 5.0 features have a blueprint under the "opencontrail" project on
Launchpad, but no series has been created yet so this URL shows all blueprints:
