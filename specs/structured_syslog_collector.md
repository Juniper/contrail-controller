#1. Introduction
This blue print describes the design, features, and implementation of "structured syslog collector" Contrail Collector.

#2. Problem statement
"structured syslog collector" will receive APPTRACK syslogs from SRX/VSRX devices and pushes the stats relating to the same into Cassandra, so that Application Visibility related views can be made available to the customer.

#3. Proposed solution
 Structured syslogs from SRX/VSRX devices contains additional data, which needs to be parsed to derive more meaningful & detailed information liek action, src_address, src_port, dst_address, dst_port, nat_src_address, nat_src_port, nat_dst_address, nat_dst_port, application, bytes-from-client, bytes-from-server etc

 sample structured syslog: <14>1 2011-11-30T00: 6:15.274 srx5800n0 RT_FLOW - APPTRACK_SESSION_CLOSE [junos@2636.1.1.1.2.26 reason="TCP RST" source-address="10.110.110.10" source-port="13175" destination-address="96.9.139.213" destination-port="48334" service-name="None" application="UNSPECIFIED-ENCRYPTED" nested-application="None" nat-source-address="10.110.110.10" nat-source-port="13175" destination-address="96.9.139.213" nat-destination-port="48334" src-nat-rule-name="None" dst-nat-rule-name="None" protocol-id="6" policy-name="dmz-out" source-zone-name="DMZ" destination-zone-name="Internet" session-id-32="44292" packets-from-client="7" bytes-from-client="1421" packets-from-server="6" bytes-from-server="1133" elapsed-time="4" username="Frank" roles="Engineering"]

 A new "structured syslog collector" needs to be implemented to receive the syslogs, which will parse the fields in the structured part of the syslog and the fields are written into the stattable using StatWalker

 Apart from the information available in the structured syslog, additional decorator information (like tenant, location, application group, application category) needs to be made available so that appropriate Application Visibility related views can be made available.

 Decorator information required is made available in the configDB as cso-hostname-record and cso-application-record

##3.1 Alternatives considered
####None

##3.2 API schema changes
The decorator information will be maintained in the configDB as cso-hostname-record and cso-application-record objects.

The cso-hostname-record records will be under csoconfigdata which will be anchored under global-system-config.

The cso-application-record will be specific to each tenant. Hence the cso-application-record will be anchored under project.

#4. Implementation
##4.1 Work items
####Schema:
Implement the XSD with the schema details for the cso-hostname-record and cso-application-record
####Collector:
Implement new "structured syslog collector" to receive structured syslogs, parse the same and push data into statTable
Implement reading of decorator information from configDB and populate appropriate fields and push into statTable
