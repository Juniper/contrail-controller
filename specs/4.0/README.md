Specs for Contrail Version 4.0
==============================

The Contrail specs process evolved over time so this directory does NOT contain
a complete set of specs for all features. The specs that WERE written and
submitted via Gerrit code review are in this directory, but some features may
have been documented elsewhere such as in PDFs or Powerpoints. These
other legacy documents are not being collected at the time of this directory
reorganization (January 2018).

At the time of Contrail 4.0 planning there was more emphasis on putting specs
into Gerrit/Git than previously, but it still wasn't an entirely formalized
process, so there is not 100% correspondence of specs to blueprints. The
features that do have blueprints can be found on Launchpad under the milestones
of r4.0.
